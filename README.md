### :white_check_mark: What is [Fast Campus](http://www.fastcampus.co.kr/)?
> **Fast Campus is an organization for IT-concentrated education.** They have many curriculums from language to web-full stack career.
> They also have data science, marketing, UX design curriculums and most of curriculums are very job-oriented. 

> **Curriculums can be divided into two groups: `camp` and `school`.**
> *`Camp`* is for business men who wants better performance at their work. Lessons are at late afternoon or at the weekend.


> *`School`*, the other, is a 3 months-compact education with a major purpose of employment.
> It aims at a specific field and hard-educate skills and concepts and almost everything about the field to students.
> This course is 8 hours a day and 5 days a week for about 2-3 months. Hard coding begins. ~~MAYDAY~~

> And I'm taking `Web Programming School` course. It covers python, Django, basic front-end skills.

> In Eastern world, human being has been called a `micro universe`. There are so many kinds of people with different thoughts and thinking. Even if we learn same things in WPS school, some outliers come up with a very breathtaking, marvelous idea that we should share with. In this folder, I will put some my friends' outstanding codes, compare to mine and leave some comments on them. I hope this repository would be creative and innovative.
